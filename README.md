# AI SaaS Platform

This project is a full-stack AI SaaS platform built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), providing a suite of AI-powered tools such as code generation, chat, and more. It features authentication, API usage limits, a modern UI, and easy extensibility for new AI features.

## Features

- **AI Tools:** Code generation, chat, and other AI utilities powered by OpenAI.
- **Authentication:** Secure user login via Clerk.
- **API Usage Limits:** Track and restrict free-tier usage.
- **Modern UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS and React components.
- **Extensible:** Easily add new AI tools or routes.
- **Deployment Ready:** Optimized for Vercel deployment.

## Uses

- **Developers:** Instantly generate code snippets, get coding help, and automate repetitive tasks.
- **Businesses:** Integrate AI-powered chat and code tools into workflows for productivity.
- **Educators/Students:** Use AI chat for learning, code explanations, and project prototyping.
- **Startups:** Rapidly prototype and test AI features without building from scratch.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes, OpenAI API
- **Database:** Prisma (for user/API usage tracking)
- **Authentication:** Clerk
- **Other:** TypeScript, ESLint, PostCSS

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required values (OpenAI API key, Clerk keys, etc.).

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

4. **Edit pages/components:**
   - Main entry: `app/page.tsx`
   - Add new tools under `app/(dashboard)/(routes)/`

## API Example

- **Code Generation:**  
  POST `/api/code` with a prompt.  
  Returns code snippets in markdown, generated by OpenAI.

## Deployment

Deploy easily on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

## Development Notes

- All API keys and sensitive data should be stored in the `.env` file and never committed to version control.
- Prisma is used for database management; run `npx prisma migrate dev` after modifying the schema.
- Clerk handles authentication and user management; configure it in the Clerk dashboard and update environment variables accordingly.
- To add new AI tools, create a new route in `app/(dashboard)/(routes)/` and corresponding API endpoints in `app/api/`.
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling; customize the design in `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css`.
- For production deployment, review environment variables and set up your database and Clerk credentials on the hosting platform.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and maintainability across the codebase.
